# Campfire Cards

## Overview

Welcome to Campfire Cards. This README file provides information about the content, creation, and learning process involved with creating this webapp.

## Introduction

### Context

As of the time of writing this, 21/01/25, the last time I used React properly was about 3-4 months ago, as I was fully invested in studying and passing my ISTQB whilst also waiting for that React project to be reviewed by my course mentor. As we all know, just a few days off can make it hard to remember something, and so I'm building this app with various purposes in mind.

### Purpose

The purpose of this webapp is to:

- Refresh my knowledge of React.
- Create a digital card game, inspired by the likes of "[The Ultimate RPG Campfire Card Deck](https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-Ultimate-RPG-Campfire-Card-Deck/James-D-Amato/Ultimate-Role-Playing-Game-Series/9781507220429)" by James D'Amato.
- Gain experience using an APi.
